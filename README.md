# Hangdroid

A classic intellectual word game «Hangman» (Виселица, Шибениця), that you might had been playing on paper at your school time. 
## Rules
In two players mode, the first player conceives a word and provides some hint. The second player seeks to find out, what is the word, trying letter by letter. If there is no such a letter, some details are added to the «gallows». If there is, all these letters are opened. The player wins, if he opens the word before the «gallows» construction is finished. Otherwise, it is a failure.

In single player mode you are given a random hidden word with its category and a brief description. Your aim is the same — find out, what is the word.

## Features

Unlike most of other implementations of the game, this one supports several languages: English, Russian, Ukraininan (although the interface is only in English). You can not mix languages in one game session, but you can easily play with your russian- english- and ukrainian-speaking friends.

The second feature is an editable words database (these words are used in single player). Having only a few words by default, you can add and remove them, creating your own word set. Every time you finish two players game with a word that is not in the database yet, you have an option to save it.

## Notes
To see the hint in sigle player mode, click the hangman picture.

To delete a word from the database, enter editing mode by clicking it, and then simply delete the text and press «Save».
